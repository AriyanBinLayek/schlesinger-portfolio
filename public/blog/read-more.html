          <h2>How to Read More</h2>

          <p>I have always admired people who are voracious readers, and as an adult, I have gone through several phases where I read whenever I can find a spare moment. Unfortunately, during the last six months, I have read very little aside from the newsfeed on my phone.<p/>
          <p>I realized I wanted to change this when a few days ago I was listening to an interview of Karen Walker on the Women in Tech Show. Walker is currently an executive consultant and she was a chief-level executive at Compaq during the companyâ€™s heyday. One of the things she attributed to her success as a leader was that she is always reading. When I heard her say that I realized that I want to be the kind of person who is always reading and letting the ideas I encounter in books seep into my life.</p>
