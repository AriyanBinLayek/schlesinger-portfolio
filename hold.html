  <h3>Why?</h3>
  <p>Attending a conference talk can expose you to new ideas or technologies, but you are passive during the presentation. In order to gain insight into new concepts, or be able to apply new skills, after the talk you will have to do the work of transforming your notes into an  <a href="http://lifesciences.fas.harvard.edu/files/lifesci/files/active_learning_2014.pdf">active learning</a> experience.
  In this blog post, I explain how.</p>

  <h3>See it in Practice</h2>
<p>On August 4, 2016, I attended a talk by <a href="http://ryanchristianmedia.com/developdenver/nodejs/" target=_blank>Ryan Ciecalone</a> called “Node for beginners, Why so Asynchronous?” Before the talk, I decided that I wanted to use the information to be able to explain why developers use Node.js, and to write working code from the concepts the speaker presented. During the talk, I took notes, and drafted objectives.
After the talk, I spent 2+ hours following the process described above. See my work in <a href="https://github.com/coloradokim/node-for-beginners" target=_blank >this</a> Github repo.
