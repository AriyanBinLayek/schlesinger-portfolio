Moving from Passive to Active Learning

1. Decide the Bloom's Verb you before or during the talk.
  Do you just want exposure to a topic? Then write objectives using explain, identify?
  Do you want to be able to dig deepr into something you know just a little bit about?  Understand or analyze?
  Do you want to use a new technology? build or create

Realistically, unless you you can't do build or create for every talk


2. Take notes during the talk. Keep them idea-centric (If you do this, you should be able to fill in the details with documentation) If the speaker doesn't provide objectives, draft them as they move from one topic to another

3. After the talk, finalize your objectives

4. Do It/ Name the Steps

5. Use your steps to do it again and again until you develop fluency with the skills
